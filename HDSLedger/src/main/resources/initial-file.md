# Initial File
There is a initial file that contains basic information  
- ids
- network address
- selected leader 
- public/private keys (?)

Unsure is Public Key Infrastructure is suppost to exist or is just the static file  
```
There is a Public Key Infrastructure in place. This means that blockchain
members (and also clients that access the blockchain) should use self-generated
public/private keys, which are pre-distributed before the start of the system, and
this information is also included in the static system membership
```

# Puppet Master

Need some script (any language) to spawn all necessary processes from the initial file.
